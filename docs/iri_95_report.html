<B>Introduction</B><br>

The 1995 Workshop of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) was held at
the National
Physical Laboratory in New Dehli, India in the second week of January. This was
the first IRI
workshop in India and quite fittingly the topic was the modeling of the
low-latitude ionosphere.
The IRI working group was greatly honored by the fact that the IRI Workshop was
made part of
the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the Indian National Science Academy (INSA)
which took place
during this same time period. The festive inauguration of the IRI workshop on
Monday morning was
highlighted by the inaugural address of Prof. S.K. Joshi (President of INSA).   
Prof. E.S.R.
 Gopal (Director of NPL), Dr. A.P. Mitra (Chair of LOC), Dr. D. Bilitza (IRI
Chair), and Dr.
D. Anderson (VIM Chair) extended their welcomes to the workshop participants and
Dr.
K. K. Mahajan (Local Organizer) concluded the inaugural session with his vote of
thanks.
Support from the local organizers was excellent during all phases of the
meeting. A special
thank you goes to Dr. K.K. Mahajan and his team who made it all possible through
their
untiring efforts before, during and after the workshop.

<p>
The workshop convened under the sponsorship of COSPAR, URSI, COSTED, TWAS, ISF/
Soros, IAGA,
INSA and CSC. COSPAR, COSTED, URSI, TWAS, INSA and ISF provided also direct
financial support
for participants from developing and post-communist countries. Of the more than
60 participants
about half were from India and the other half from Brazil, China, Czech
Republic, England, Japan,
Poland, Russia, Taiwan and USA. The host country was represented by scientists
from ISRO Bangalore,
PRL Ahmedabad, VSSC Trivandrum, Saurashtra U. Rajkot, Dehli U., Dibrugarh U.,
Andhra U.
Visakhapatnam, Govt. College Bareli, Barkatullah U. Bhopal, and NPL New Dehli.
The more than
70 papers were grouped into the following 10 sessions: Low Latitude Data and
Comparisons with IRI;
Theoretical Studies; Scintillations, Spread-F and other Irregularities;
Verification of
Ionospheric Models; F-Region Improvements; Ion Composition; Regional Models and
Mappings;
TEC and Tomographic Studies; Topside and Plasmasphere; D-Region. A half-day
session on Wednesday
was reserved for the Validation of Ionospheric Models (VIM) effort of URSI
Working Group G.4
(D. Anderson, AFPL, Chair); this activity is closely correlated with the
URSI/COSPAR IRI effort.
A Final Discussions and Decisions session on Friday afternoon concluded the
workshop. 

<p>
Following the trend of recent IRI meetings, increasing weight is now being put
on regional
modelling/mapping, on results from computer simulations that could benefit the
IRI modelling,
and on accurate representation of the total electron content (TEC), which is the
ionospheric
parameter most important for a wide range of applications/forecasts; this is in
addition to
the more traditional statistical, comparative  IRI studies involving large data
volumes. Data
sources used in the comparative studies presented at this workshop included: (i)
TOPEX and
ACTIVE satellite data, (ii) Total Electron Content (TEC) data from equatorial
ground stations
to the Navy Navigation Satellite System (NNSS), to FLEETSAT, and to ETS, (iii)
Indian, Russian
and Brazilian rocket data from equatorial rocket flights, (iv) data from
low-latitude ionosondes
(digisondes and earlier instruments), (v) data from incoherent scatter and HF
radars at low latitudes.

<p><B>TEC Studies</B><br>

Faraday rotation TEC measurements over New Dehli from 1977 tto 1980 show
reasonable agreement
with IRI; IRI, however, does not reproduce the distinct postsunset maximum that
is observed
during winter and equinox (L. Singh, J. Gupta, T. Tyagi, NPL, India). 

<p>
M. Abdu (INPE, Brazil) reviewed IRI studies with data from the Brazilian
longitude sector.
Overall good agreement was found. However, a number of specific problems are
noted that need
to be addressed. In particular, it was found that at equatorial latitudes IRI
over-estimates
TEC at low solar activity and underestimates TEC at high solar activity. Similar
results were
reported for the high solar activity TEC at the anomaly-crest-stations Rajkot,
India (K. Iyer)
and Luping, Taiwan (K. Cheng). Using the Luping TEC data K. Cheng confirmed that
the equator
anomaly is mainly a daytime phenomenon (sunrise to almost midnight) and that the
winter crest
is usually larger than the summer crest. IRI describes the diurnal occurrence
pattern correct
but not the winter maximum. Further studies were initiated. It is especially
important to
combine the TEC data with ionosonde data for the peak to establish the cause for
the remaining
discrepancy (peak or topside?). [Efforts continue: Abdu, Cheng, Iyer]

<p>
TEC values deduced from TOPEX altimeter measurements provide a global mapping of
the equator
anomaly region in the ocean areas with a 10-day repeat cycle. The data show
considerable
longitudinal and seasonal differences in the location and magnitude of the
anomaly crests
reflecting the influence of the neutral wind and the ExB ion drift (Bilitza,
USA).

<p>
Interesting first results were presented from tomographic studies across the
equator anomaly
region at American longitudes (J. Klobuchar, D. Anderson et al., AFPL, USA) and
at Taiwanese
longitudes (C. Huang, K. Yeh et al., NCU, Taiwan). Both teams use the NNSS dual
frequency signals
and both teams are in the process of setting up more receiving stations to
improve the quality
of their tomographic reconstruction. The Taiwanese team uses IRI to specify
initial conditions.  

<p><B>Middle Ionosphere</B><br>

Data from the incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo, Puerto Rico have contributed
largely to
the development and improvement of the IRI electron density model in the middle
ionosphere.
K. Mahajan (NPL, India) reviewed the earlier studies as well as possible future
improvements.
In a joint contribution with T. Gulyaeva (IZMIRAN, Russia), he proposed an
improved low-latitude
formula for the half-density point; this will be included in the next version of
IRI.
[New IRI formula for h0.5: Mahajan, Gulyaeva, Sethi]

<p>
B. Reinisch (UML, USA) used data from several digisondes operating at low
latitudes to study
the electron density profile between the E and F peaks. The dominant IRI
parameters in this
altitude range are strongly biased towards mid-latitudes because of the global
uneveness of
the underlying data base. Following a recommendation that was made at last
year's IRI task
force activity at ICTP (Trieste, Italy), his team investigated the density and
gradient at
a fixed height (170 km) rather than at the height of the F1 ledge, which
typically varies
by 10-20% from day to day. It was suggested to also study the density variation
at a second
fixed height in the 180-190 km range; the difference between the two points
would than provide
the density gradient. Inclusion of these two points in IRI should lead to a
better representation
of the electron density in the F1-region. The UML team also presented a better
algorithm for
obtaining monthly average representative profiles (MARP). [N170 and N185:
Reinisch and Digisonde
community; Radicella and ICTP team]

<p>
The IRI model in the E-F region was also compared with several station-years
worth of data
from China (X.-Y. Huang and S.-R. Zhang, Wuhan, China), from Argentina (M.
Mosert de Gonzalez,
Argentina), and from Arecibo, Puerto Rico (V. Pandey and N. Sethi, NPL, India).
Although
overall IRI represents the most important trends, specific discrepancies were
noted and need
to be further investigated. N. Sethi (NPL, India) fitted a combination of 4 LAY
functions to
Arecibo E-F region profiles and proposed a number of improvements for the
parameters used
in the current implementation of the IRI LAY-option.

<p><B>Theoretical Studies</B><br>

Interesting new results obtained with the Sheffield University Plasmasphere
Ionosphere Model
(SUPIM) were presented by G. Bailey and N. Balan (Sheffield U., U.K.). Studying
the effect of
the neutral winds in different longitude sectors they were able to explain the
longitudinal
differences in the interhemispheric asymmetry of the anomaly. During prenoon
hours when the
upward drift is large and the plasma flows towards the equator from both
hemispheres they find
an additional peak/layer ("G-layer") a few 100 km above the F layer. Y. Su, K.
Oyama et al.
(ISAS, Japan) find that SUPIM reproduces quite well the electron densities and
temperatures
measured by the OHZARA satellite at 600 km altitude, if the ExB drift and the
neutral winds
are reasonably adjusted. 

<p>
A discrepancy between IRI and observations, that was often mentioned during this
workshop,
involves the F peak height hmF2. IRI does not reproduce the characteristic
evening peak in
hmF2 observed at the magnetic equator. This feature is closely related to the
sharp spike in
upward ion drift at that time. D. Anderson (AFPL, USA) showed how this aspect of
IRI could be
improved using parameters from his Parameterized Ionospheric Model (PIM). PIM is
based on a
theoretical model that includes as input the Jicamarca ion drifts, and thus
provides a much
better representation of the equatorial hmF2 in the evening. D. Anderson offered
to provide
analytic representations of the PIM hmF2 and F layer thickness parameters and it
was decided
to include these as a new PIM option in IRI. Outside the equator anomaly region
good agreement
is found between hmF2-IRI and observations, as was shown by V. Pandey and N.
Sethi (NPL, India)
for Arecibo incoherent scatter data. [PIM formulas: Anderson]

<p>
First results of their respective modeling efforts were presented by the
Wuhan/ICTP modeling
team (S.-R. Zhang, Wuhan, China), by K.S. Murthy (Andhra U., India) and by M.
Goel (NPL, India).
Modeling efforts of the ICTP/Wuhan team are focussed on the lower transition
height (atomic to
molecular ions). Their theoretical results favor the formula established by W.
Oliver (1975).
Efforts are currently underway to include the transition height as a seperate
parameter in IRI;
the Oliver model would be an excellent candidate for this project. [Transition
heights in IRI:
Bilitza, Danilov, Zhang]

<p><B>Electric Field, Ion Drift, and Spread-F</B><br>

B. Krishna Murthy (Trivandrum, India) reviewed studies of the F region electric
field in the
low-latitude ionosphere with particular emphasis on the work done at his
equatorial station
stressing the similarities and differences to results from Jicamarca. Data from
an All-Indian
HF Doppler radar network (dip=0-42N) were used by O. Nagpal (U. Dehli), J.
Shastri (Bangalore),
and C. Raghava Reddi (Trivandrum) to study the contribution of electric fields
and meridional
winds to the F-region plasma vertical drift. N. Balan and G. Bailey, (U.
Sheffield, U.K) find
that vertical drifts deduced from hmF2 measurements at Trivandrum (India) agree
favorably with
Jicamarca incoherent scatter measurements but differ significantly from
Trivandrum HF Doppler
data. [Bilitza to contact B. Fejer and his team about participation in the IRI
ion drift modeling]

<p>

Spread-F and Sporadic-E occurrence statistics for the Indian sub-continent were
presented by R. Saksena (NPL, India) based on data from this longitude sector.
K. Iyer et al. (Rajkot, India) compared scintillations obtained near the anomaly
crests with the scintillation models of Aarons (AFPL) and Basu (AFPL) and
suggested suitable modifications. Scintillation and Spread-F occurrence
statistics were also reported for Waltair (P. Sriram et al., Andhra U., India)
and China (X.-Y. Huang and S.-R. Zhang, Wuhan, China). A diffracting lenses
simulation of scintillation patterns in the ionosphere was discussed by  R.
Dabas and D. Lakshmi (NPL, India). A special IRI task force was established
under the leadership of M. Abdu (INPE, Brazil) to establish/recommend
Spread-F/Scintillation models for inclusion in IRI. [Spread-F task force: Abdu,
Basu, Saksena, Iyer, Matuura/Maruyama]

<p><B>Global and Regional Mapping of F-Peak Parameter</B><br>

S. Shastri, S. Aggerwal and N.K. Sethi (NPL, India) compared the IRI/CCIR maps
for the F peak critical frequency foF2 with several years of data from three
Indian stations stretching across the anomaly region (Kodaikanal, magnetic
equator; Ahemadabad, anomaly crest; Dehli, outside anomaly). They find good
agreement at low and medium solar activity but large discrepancies for K and A
during high solar activity with IRI overestimating the measured foF2 (contrary
to the trend observed in TEC!). This might be attributed to the movement of the
location of the anomaly crests with solar activity (due to the increase in
neutral winds) and to the insufficient representation of this effect in IRI.

<p>

Jiao Peinan and Wu Jian (Xinxiang, China) described the Chinese Reference
Ionosphere (CRI) and the solar activity index Ic and the Asia-Oceania Region
(AOR) F-peak mapping used in CRI. A regional model for F-peak parameters over
the Indian subcontinent was presented by S. Aggerwal (NPL, India). P. Bhuyan
(Dibrugarh U., India) used data from four Indian stations to establish a model
for the 75¡E meridian. Comparisons with IRI highlight the advantages of these
regional models/maps. Inclusion of some of the regional maps presented during
this and the previous IRI workshop are planned for a future edition of the IRI
model. [Inclusion of PRIME maps: Mikhailov]

<p>
An empirical model for TEC at Luping, Taiwan was presented by S. Jain (Bareli,
India). The low-latitude electron density and temperature in the height range
500 to 2500 km was modeled based on data from the ACTIVE satellite (L. Triskova,
Praha, Czech Rep.). 

<p><B>Topside and Plasmasphere</B><br>

V. Pandey and N. Sethi (NPL, India) find that topside data from the Arecibo
incoherent scatter radar are consistently below IRI predictions. This is in
contrast to the equatorial ionosphere where IRI has been shown to underestimate
the topside densities measured by the radar at Jicamarca, Peru. K. Oyama et al.
(ISAS, Japan) further pursued the mapping of OHZORA electron temperature and
density data at the satellite altitude of 600 km. I. Kimura et al. (Kyoto U.,
Japan) described ways of connecting their plasmaspheric AKEBONO-based model with
IRI. [Continuing efforts: Kimura, Oyama, Bilitza]

<p><B>Lower Ionosphere</B><br>

S. Gupta (Ahmedabad, India) gave an overview of Indian rocket measurements and
comparisons with IRI. Electron density profiles obtained from rockets launched
from Thumba and SHAR in India were discussed and interpreted by S. Prakash
(Ahmedabad, India). A.P. Mitra (CSIR, India) reviewed Indian measurements and
modeling activities in the region below 100 km  down to stratospheric and
tropospheric altitudes. Rocket data are particularly important for the
improvement of IRI in the E- and D-regions. Unfortunately only a rather limited
set of measurements exists for low latitudes. A. Danilov (IAG, Russia) compared
the IRI ion composition with measurements from rockets launched from Thumba,
India and from Russian research vessels and suggested appropriate low-latitude
modifications of the IRI model. At last year's IRI meeting it was decided to
include in IRI the D-region models of Friedrich (Graz, Austria) and A. Danilov
(IAG, Russia); incorporation of these two new options is currently underway.
[D-region team: Friedrich, Danilov, Kopp, Singer] 

<p><B>Miscellaneous</B><br>

It was suggested (and accepted) to allow input of measured M(3000)F2 values if
available for computation of the F2 peak height hmF2.

<p>
P. Pasricha, S. Aggerwal and S. Shastri (NPL, India) pointed out that
traditional RMS-type descriptions of ionospheric variability underestimate the
actual hour-to-hour, day-to-day, or month-to-month variability due the
non-random nature of foF2 variations.

<p>
A. Mikhailov (IAG, Russia) discussed equatorial F-region strom effects and their
dependence on changes in the nuetral gas composition and the ExB vertical ion
drift.

<p>
T. Gulyaeva (IZMIRAN, Russia) further explained the ionospheric disturbance
index developed for the European PRIME project and compared indices obtained
from high and mid-latitude stations with those from low-latitude stations.

<p>
I. Stanislawska (SRC, Warsaw, Poland) described a Kriging method that can be
used for the regional mapping of ionospheric parameters.
